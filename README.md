### Hi, I'm Szymon.
**Lead Architect | Engineering Manager | Distributed Systems Specialist**

I specialize in designing and stabilizing **Critical Financial Infrastructure** under high-throughput constraints. My focus is on **System Reliability**, **Zero Trust Security**, and **Legacy Modernization** in Tier-1 Banking and Fintech environments.

I don't just write code; I design systems that handle millions of transactions without downtime.

### ⚡ Philosophy

> *"Code is a liability, functionality is an asset."*

I believe in pragmatic engineering. I prefer boring, battle-tested technology for critical paths and reserve innovation for where it gives a competitive edge. My architectural decisions are driven by **TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)** and **Business Value**, not hype.
